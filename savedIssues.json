The anchor claims to be in UTF-8, but it contains hexadecimal codes. \r\n\r\nWorse, the hexadecimal codes are not valid. For example, it returns `\\xE3\\xA9` instead of `\\xC3\\xA9` for an é. I suspect that what is happening is that the string has been incorrectly converted to lowercase, changing \\xc3 to \\xe3. The lowercase conversion has assumed latin1 encoding when it was actually utf-8.
